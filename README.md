# sda_fabio
This work applies a structural decomposition analysis to the FABIO model (see https://github.com/gru-wu/fabio for further information on FABIO) and is currently under preparation. The aim is to determine drivers of food and non-food biomass consumption with their specific impact on the changes of land footprints.
